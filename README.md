# Chest-Xray-Prediction

In this project we did a transfer learning exercise to train
a model for image recognition on the chest X-ray dataset.

We have used the Keras data loader to read the train and test images

We have achieved above 90% accuracy on the test dataset.

We have fine tune the weights of the pre-trained model.
